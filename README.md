## Credit

Thanks to [Frederic Vogels](https://github.com/fvogels) for checking, creating and contributing to these exercises. Due to restructuring, the commits are no longer in the commit log, but will not be forgotten.

These exercises were originally created for the course Distributed Applications at [UCLL](https://www.ucll.be/). Most of this content is thus sponsored by UCLL.

Extra thanks to every contributor, student and the Elixir community.

## Note

This project is part of the [elixir learning materials](https://github.com/WannesFransen1994/elixir-learning-materials) repository.

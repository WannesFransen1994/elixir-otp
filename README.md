# Elixir OTP

## Goal

In this course we'll cover the OTP aspects of Elixir. We assume that you've completed the [elixir-basics](https://github.com/WannesFransen1994/elixir-basics) course. The topics are listed under [Topics](#topics), which will be a short summary of what is covered in this repository.

## Usage

For this course we'll mostly still use the script method to complete the exercises. Later on, we'll move on to mix projects.

## Topics

- [X] Processes
- [X] Links, monitors
- [X] Tasks
- [X] GenServer
- [X] Supervisor

## Roadmap / missing topics

- [ ] Mix projects
- [ ] Observer
